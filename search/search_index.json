The release of GPT-4 was a wake-up call for many, myself included. Large Language Model (LLM) technology has pushed the boundaries of what can be achieved.</p> <p>More and more code is being created with the help of co-pilots, which are rapidly improving. From GitHub Copilot autocompleting a few lines of code to Devin, an autonomous agent that can solve engineering tasks on its own. The progress in just one year is amazing!</p> <p>However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. The code generated by LLMs is not necessarily secure. It's easier than ever to create code, even without being a trained developer. This ease of code generation, coupled with the potential security vulnerabilities in AI-generated code, means that more vulnerabilities are being introduced into software systems. As a result, engineering teams face a growing backlog of vulnerabilities to address, leading to increased frustration and a tilt in favor of attackers.</p> <p>At this inflection point, we must ask ourselves: How can AI be used by defenders in ways that weren't possible before?</p> <p>We have seen the first promising applications of generative AI for security. LLMs are being used to reduce false positives and generate fixes for vulnerabilities, doing so much better than any previous tool. This is already an enormous value add.</p> <p>However, security engineers and developers still need to do a lot of manual work to keep up with all the vulnerabilities. The only solution is to increasingly automate this manual work by leveraging AI Security Engineers.</p>","tags":["Application Security","AI Security Engineering","Autonomous Agents"]},{"location":"Thoughts/2024/04/02/the-rise-of-ai-security-engineers/#what-are-ai-security-engineers","title":"What are AI Security Engineers","text":"<p>AI Security Engineers are autonomous agents that leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform security tasks independently. LLMs are advanced AI models that can understand and generate language, enabling AI Security Engineers to comprehend the context and intent behind code. By utilizing LLMs, AI Security Engineers can adapt to new coding patterns, frameworks, and attack vectors, providing a more dynamic and human-like approach to application security compared to traditional tools.</p> <p>Traditional security tools rely on static rulesets that generate a high number of false positives, flagging issues that aren't actually vulnerabilities. This leads to wasted time and resources as teams investigate and address these false alarms.</p> <p>In contrast, AI Security Engineers understand the context and logic behind the code, allowing them to reduce false alerts and increase accuracy. They can identify complex vulnerabilities that tools miss, such as business logic flaws or authentication weaknesses.</p> <p>A common example is when tools detect cryptography-related issues, such as the use of MD5 or insecure random generators, but require a human to review whether they are used in a security-sensitive context or can be ignored. Similarly, AI Security Engineers can identify vulnerabilities such as missing authorization checks, that are difficult for traditional tools to detect. In both cases, AI Security Engineers can more accurately assess the security impact without human intervention.</p> <p>Furthermore, AI Security Engineers can learn from the feedback and preferences they receive from human security experts. This allows them to refine their vulnerability detection and remediation capabilities over time, adapting to each organization's unique environment. For instance, AI Security Engineers can prioritize vulnerabilities based on the organization's risk appetite, provide contextual information to help human experts make informed decisions, and suggest remediation strategies that align with the development team's practices.</p> <p>By collaborating with AI Security Engineers, teams can significantly reduce the growing backlog of potential vulnerabilities and improve the overall security posture of their applications. AI Security Engineers can save developers significant time and effort in addressing these issues by providing tailored remediation advice. For example, an AI Security Engineer can provide a developer with a list of recommended code changes to fix a vulnerability, along with an explanation of why those changes are necessary. The developer can then review the suggestions, make any necessary modifications, and implement the fixes more efficiently.</p> <p>However, it's crucial to recognize that human expertise remains essential in certain situations, such as evaluating the business impact of a vulnerability or deciding on the appropriate remediation strategy in complex scenarios. AI Security Engineers are designed to augment and support human expertise, not replace it entirely. The goal is to create a synergistic relationship where AI and humans work together to achieve better security outcomes.</p>","tags":["Application Security","AI Security Engineering","Autonomous Agents"]},{"location":"Thoughts/2024/04/02/the-rise-of-ai-security-engineers/#towards-full-autonomy","title":"Towards Full Autonomy","text":"<p>The first uses of AI in security are promising, but we are only at the beginning of the journey towards fully autonomous AI Security Engineers. AI Security Engineers have to be made accessible to defenders as quickly as possible. If we fail to do so, attackers might create autonomous AI hackers first, which could have devastating consequences.</p> <p>The potential impact of fully autonomous AI Security Engineers cannot be overstated. I believe that the way we approach security 5 years from now will be unrecognizable compared to today. Imagine a future where security is effortless for teams, where the frustration and friction associated with application security are a thing of the past. In this future, AI Security Engineers work tirelessly behind the scenes, continuously monitoring, analyzing, and improving the security posture of applications without slowing down development.</p> <p>To make this a reality, AI Security Engineers need to be accessible to everyone building software. This means developing AI-powered security solutions that are affordable, easy to integrate, and scalable to meet the needs of organizations of all sizes. Autonomous agents equipped with the full context of a business are much more powerful than autonomous agents with limited context, which for the first time will put defenders at an advantage over attackers.</p> <p>Bridging the gap between our current state and fully autonomous AI Security Engineers is a complex challenge. It requires a strategic approach and a deep understanding of both AI and application security. But it's a challenge we must tackle head-on.</p> <p>In the next piece, I will dive into the 6 levels of Application Security Automation and present a roadmap for achieving fully autonomous AI Security Engineers.
