From GitHub Copilot completing a few lines of code to Devin, an autonomous agent that can solve engineering tasks on its own. It's easier than ever to create code, even without being a trained developer.</p> <p>However, the code generated by LLMs is not necessarily secure. The ease of code generation, coupled with the potential security vulnerabilities in AI-generated code, means that more vulnerabilities are being introduced into software.

LLMs are advanced AI models that can understand and generate language, enabling AI Security Engineers to comprehend the context and intent behind code in a more dynamic and human-like way.</p> <p>In contrast to traditional security tools that rely on static rulesets, AI Security Engineers understand the context and logic behind the code, allowing them to reduce false alerts and increase accuracy. They can identify complex vulnerabilities that tools miss, such as business logic flaws and authorization weaknesses.</p> <p>A common example is when tools detect cryptography-related issues, such as the use of MD5 or insecure random generators, but require a human to review whether they are used in a security-sensitive context or can be ignored. AI Security Engineers can more accurately assess the security impact without human intervention.</p> <p>AI Security Engineers help developers reduce the growing backlog of vulnerabilities by providing tailored remediation advice. They can provide a developer with a list of recommended code changes to fix a vulnerability, along with an explanation of why those changes are necessary. The developer can then review the suggestions, make any necessary modifications, and implement the fixes more efficiently.</p> <p>AI Security Engineers can learn from the feedback and preferences they receive from human security experts and adapt to each organization's unique environment. They can prioritize vulnerabilities based on the organization's risk appetite and suggest remediation strategies that align with the development team's practices.</p> <p>AI Security Engineers are designed to augment and support human expertise, not replace it entirely.
