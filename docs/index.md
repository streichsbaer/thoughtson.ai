# Welcome to Thoughts on AI

It took the launch of GPT-4 for me to realize what Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of. I've been hooked ever since.

AI is transforming industries at an unprecedented pace, from creative applications to technical domains like medicine, material sciences, and application security. The rapid advancements in AI co-pilots and autonomous agents are both exciting and frightening. 

While these breakthroughs open up new possibilities and efficiencies, they also raise important questions about the ethical implications, job displacement, and the need for regulatory frameworks to keep pace with the technology. With new developments happening every week, it's crucial to stay informed and engaged in the conversation.

I'm spending significant time learning, understanding, and applying the new concepts and tools enabled by AI technology and the rapidly emerging AI ecosystem. Both for my personal and professional life. This blog helps me document my thoughts and explorations in a structured way, and I hope that it will be useful to others who share my passion.

Connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=s_streichsbier). I would love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and ideas.

Let's ride the exponential together!
