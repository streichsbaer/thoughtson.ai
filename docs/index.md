# Welcome to Thoughts on AI üëãüèª

It took the launch of GPT-4 for me to realize what Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of. I've been hooked ever since.

A lot is happening every week, and it's becoming hard to keep track of all the progress and the related implications.

I'm spending significant time learning, understanding, and applying the new concepts and tools enabled by AI technology and the rapidly emerging AI ecosystem. Both for my personal and professional life.

This blog helps me document my thoughts and explorations in a structured way and I hope that it will be useful to others that share my passion.

Connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=s_streichsbier), I would love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and ideas.

Let's ride the exponential together!
